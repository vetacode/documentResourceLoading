<!-- 
 
Examples with defer: two scripts long.js and small.js, but now with async instead of defer.
They don’t wait for each other. Whatever loads first (probably small.js) – runs first: 

Real usage:
Async scripts are great when we integrate an independent third-party script into the page: counters, ads and so on, as they don’t depend on our scripts, and our scripts shouldn’t wait for them

NOTES:
The async attribute is only for external scripts
Just like defer, the async attribute is ignored if the <script> tag has no src.
