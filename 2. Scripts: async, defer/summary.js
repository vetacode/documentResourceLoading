// Summary
// Both async and defer have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesn’t block page rendering. So the user can read page content and get acquainted with the page immediately.

// But there are also essential differences between them:

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//         | Order	                                                                                  | DOMContentLoaded
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// async	 | Load-first order. Their document order doesn’t matter – which loads first runs first	    | Irrelevant. May load and execute while the document has not yet been fully downloaded. That happens if scripts are small or cached, and the document is long enough.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// defer	 | Document order (as they go in the document).                                             | Execute after the document is loaded and parsed (they wait if needed), right before DOMContentLoaded.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// In practice, defer is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important.

// And async is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads. And their relative execution order does not matter.
