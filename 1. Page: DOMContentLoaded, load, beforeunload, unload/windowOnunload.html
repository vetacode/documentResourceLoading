<!-- It sends the data in the background just before user leaves the page.
The transition to another page is not delayed: the browser leaves the page, but still performs sendBeacon.

The request is sent as POST.
We can send not only a string, but also forms and other formats, as described in the chapter Fetch, but usually it’s a stringified object.
The data is limited by 64kb. -->
