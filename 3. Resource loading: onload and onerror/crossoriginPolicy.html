<!-- 
Details errors info may vary depending on the browser, but the idea is the same: any information about the internals of a script, including error stack traces, is hidden. Exactly because it’s from another domain.

To allow cross-origin access, the <script> tag needs to have the crossorigin attribute, plus the remote server must provide special headers.

There are three levels of cross-origin access:
1. No crossorigin attribute – access prohibited.
2. crossorigin="anonymous" – access allowed if the server responds with the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin with * or our origin. Browser does not send authorization information and cookies to remote server.
3. crossorigin="use-credentials" – access allowed if the server sends back the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin with our origin and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. Browser sends authorization information and cookies to remote server.
